# Slide Decks

*EduBricks*-based slide decks for FAIR asset reuse. :stars:

Please visit https://edubrickshub.github.io/slide-decks/ to find the example slide decks.

## Idea

- This repository handles slides and styles (no assets, no images) and renders the slide decks via [Slidev](https://sli.dev/)
- Images can be handled and sourced from anywhere else (i.e. URLs) to keep this repo lightweight
- EduBricks & EduPaths are sourced as git submodule from https://github.com/EduBricksHub/EduBricks
